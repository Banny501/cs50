These are my assignments completed during course CS50.

pset0:
In zero pset, you need to make a program in a Scratch programming language.
I made an analogue of the game flappy bird and called it flappy cat.
To start the game, open the site scratch.mit.edu, go to the creator item, click the file, 
load from the computer and select the archive with the game. 
Click the green flag to start the game, enjoy.
